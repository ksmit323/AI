AI projects

This repository contains all the code I have written for "AI" related projects.

So far, all of these projects are the works of Harvard's CS50 Intro to AI course.  

I did not write all the code for these projects.  For example, in TicTacToe, I only wrote the "backend" functional code that allows the AI to select the most optimal move.  I did NOT write the PYGAME user interface code.
