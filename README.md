# AI
AI projects

This repository contains all the code I have written for "AI" related projects.

So far, all of these projects are from Harvard's CS50 Intro to AI course.  

For some projects I was given distribution code.  For example, in TicTacToe, I only wrote the "backend" functional code that allows the AI to select the most optimal move.  I did NOT write the PYGAME user interface code.
